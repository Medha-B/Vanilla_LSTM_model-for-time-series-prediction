# Vanilla_LSTM_model-for-time-series-prediction
A Vanilla LSTM is an LSTM model that has a single hidden layer of LSTM units, and an output layer used to make a prediction. The code is written for univariate time-series prediction. In the code, data is prepared first, then we fit the model and make predictions.
Framework based on Keras and Tensorflow.
